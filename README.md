# GitHub Fullstack Application

This web application uses the GitHub API for fetching all the commits from its own repository. It uses a cron job for fetching new commits every hour. It will be executed every hour at the 59th minute.

## Running Locally

### Pre-requisites for Running Locally

- Its important to create shared-cluster-database at the [MongoDB Atlas Website](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

- Once the database is created you must add a new **_.env_** file at the `./server` folder with the following parameters:

```bash
  PORT=8000
  MONGO_URL="<paste the mongo URL that the MongoDB Atlas Platform gave you>"
  GITHUB_TOKEN="<paste the github access token that you generated>"
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME="<write the repository name whose commits you´re interested in>"
  GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER="write the name of the owner of the repository"
```

- For more information on how to generate the GitHub Access Token, you can access this GitHub document on [Creating a Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- For more information on how to use the GitHub API for listing a repository's commit history, you can access this [document](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/commits/commits)

### Running Locally

At the root folder of the project, you can execute the following commands

```bash
  npm run install
```

#### Start the application on development mode

```bash
  npm run deploy
```

#### Run tests

```bash
  npm run test
```

###### Note: When running tests, only backend tests will pass. Once the backend tests have been executed, you can press `Ctrl + c` for cancelling the process

## Running Dockerized Application on your Machine

### Pre-requisites

- Having Docker installed in your machine

### Running Dockerized Application

```bash
  docker run --restart=always -p 8000:8000 leonidasrq/github-project
```
Once the Docker container is running, you can access the following address for checking it out:

```bash
  http://localhost:8000
```
